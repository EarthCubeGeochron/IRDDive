Dear Editors,

We resubmit for your consideration our revised manuscript “A model workflow for locating Pliocene and Pleistocene Ice-Rafted Debris using GeoDeepDive.”  We have carefully attended to both reviewers’ comments, which we summarize here.
First, we have checked all code and ensured that all `rMarkdown` code is properly rendered in the resubmitted version. We deeply apologize for this error, and for the inconvenience this error caused to the reviewers and editor.

Second, we have clarified that the goal of this paper is not to provide a start-to-finish workflow that could accurately identify the time and location of all IRD events, but rather to present a model workflow for GeoDeepDive and its text search capabilities.  We note several of the complexities raised by Reviewer 2 (e.g. the distinction among different kinds of processes that generate ice rafted debris) and clarify that the main goal of these capabilities is to increase the scale and scope of large literature meta-analyses.

We thank you and the reviewers for your time and attention.  All authors have approved the resubmission of this manuscript, and it is not under consideration for publication anywhere else.

Thank you,

Simon Goring
